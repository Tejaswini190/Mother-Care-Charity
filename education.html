        <h4>Providing Essentials for Students</h4>
        <ul>Long-term recovery is the phase of disaster response that begins after immediate
          relief and focuses on helping communities rebuild their lives in safe, sustainable ways.
          It goes beyond repairing damage — it works to restore housing, livelihoods, schools, healthcare,
          and social networks while addressing the root causes of vulnerability

        <h4>Scholarships and Higher Education</h4>
        <ul>Scholarships and higher education programs offered by charities and development organizations 
        aim to break cycles of poverty and open pathways to opportunity. They give students  especially 
        those from low-income families, disaster-affected regions, or marginalized groups access to universities,
        vocational institutes, or professional training they might otherwise not afford

        <h4>Libraries and Digital Learning</h4>
        <ul>Libraries and digital learning programs supported by charities give communities access 
        to knowledge, technology, and opportunities for lifelong education. Modern libraries are more
        than book-lending centers — they offer safe spaces for study, internet access, workshops, and
        cultural activities, while digital learning platforms bring lessons, tutorials, and professional
        courses to anyone with a phone or computer

        <h4>Skill Development Workshops</h4>
        <ul>Skill development workshops run by charities or community organizations help people gain
        practical abilities that improve employment prospects, entrepreneurship, and self-reliance. 
        They may focus on areas like computer literacy, tailoring, carpentry, sustainable farming, 
        or communication and leadership. These programs are especially valuable for youth, women, or 
        disaster-affected populations seeking to rebuild their livelihoods
