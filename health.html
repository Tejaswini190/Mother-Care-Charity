        <h3>Medical Camps</h3>
        <p>Medical camps are temporary health clinics organized by charities, NGOs, or community groups to bring
          essential healthcare services directly to people who might otherwise struggle to access them. They’re often
          set up in rural areas, disaster zones, or low-income neighborhoods, providing free or low-cost consultations,
          basic treatments, vaccinations, maternal and child care, and health education.

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>Health Awareness</h3>
        <p>Health awareness refers to helping people understand how their everyday choices, 
          environment, and access to care affect their well-being — and encouraging habits 
          that prevent illness. Charities, schools, and health organizations often run campaigns, 
          workshops, and screenings to teach communities about topics such as nutrition, hygiene, vaccination,
          reproductive health, and managing chronic diseases.

        <h3>Vaccination Drives</h3>
      <p>Vaccination drives are organized efforts — often led by charities, health departments, or 
        international agencies  to deliver vaccines to large groups of people, especially in areas 
        where routine health services may not reach everyone. They’re vital during outbreaks or 
        when trying to protect communities from preventable diseases such as measles, polio, influenza, or COVID-19.

        <h3>Mental Health Support</h3>
        <p>
          Mental health support in charitable and humanitarian work focuses on helping people cope with stress, grief,
          trauma, or other emotional challenges, especially after disasters or during difficult life circumstances. 
          It can include counseling, peer-support groups, helplines, art or play therapy, and training community members
          to offer basic psychological first aid.
