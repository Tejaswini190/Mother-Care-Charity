        <h3>Community Recovery</h3>
        <p>
          Charities play a crucial role in helping people and communities when disasters strike. 
          When floods, earthquakes, fires, or other crises occur, many organizations step in to
           provide immediate relief such as food, clean water, medical care, and safe shelter.
          Once the emergency phase has passed, they also help with long-term recovery by rebuilding 
          homes and schools, supporting health systems, and offering counseling for survivors who may 
          be coping with trauma
